# CreateReports
The python script generates synthetic time-series data, calculates statistics, and creates plots,  excel, and HTML reports.

The artificial datasets are created using the "generate_timeseries_df" function.  

When the function is called, arguments (startdate,enddate,frequency,cols,lowlimit,and highlimit) are passed to return the synthetic time-series.
